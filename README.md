## Project Overview
This project presents an agent-based model to simulate consumer decision-making in the context of video game purchases. It aims to aid game development companies in understanding how different characteristics of video games influence consumer buying behavior. The model takes into account individual consumer preferences for game attributes like graphics, gameplay, story, and price, as well as their budgets. The simulation provides insights into which game features are most appealing to consumers, which could guide game development and marketing strategies.

## Technical Details
### Dependencies
- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualizing data.

### Structure
#### 1. Consumer Class
- **Purpose**: Represents a consumer with specific preferences and a budget.
- **Attributes**:
  - `graphics_pref`: Preference for graphics quality.
  - `gameplay_pref`: Preference for gameplay.
  - `story_pref`: Preference for story.
  - `price_pref`: Sensitivity to price.
  - `budget`: Available budget for purchasing games.
  - `game`: The game chosen by the consumer (initially None).
- **Methods**:
  - `choose_game(games)`: Evaluates and chooses a game from a list of games based on preferences and game attributes.

#### 2. Game Class
- **Purpose**: Represents a video game with specific characteristics.
- **Attributes**:
  - `graphics`: Graphics quality of the game.
  - `gameplay`: Gameplay quality of the game.
  - `story`: Story quality of the game.
  - `price`: Price of the game.

#### 3. Simulation Setup
- **Consumers**: 20 consumers are created with randomly assigned preferences and budgets.
- **Games**: 5 games are created with random characteristics (graphics, gameplay, story) and prices between 10 and 60.

#### 4. Simulation Execution
- The simulation runs for 10 iterations. In each iteration, every consumer chooses a game based on their preferences.

#### 5. Visualization
- A bar graph is generated showing the number of purchases for each game. This visual representation helps in understanding the popularity of each game among the simulated consumers.

## Running the Simulation
1. Ensure that Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib are installed.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the simulation.
3. Observe the bar graph for analysis of consumer preferences.

## Usage Scenario
This model is particularly useful for game developers and marketers to analyze consumer behavior and preferences in the gaming industry. By adjusting the characteristics of the games and the preferences of the consumers, different scenarios can be simulated to gauge potential market reactions to new games.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate a larger dataset of consumer preferences.
- Integrate real-world gaming market data for more accurate simulations.
- Add more game attributes like genre, platform compatibility, and multiplayer options.
- Implement machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis of consumer behavior.
